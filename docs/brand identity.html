		<h2>Rules and recommendations</h2>
		<h3>Exclusivity</h3>
		<p>To the exception of external partnership units or projects, the EPFL logo is the only official logo within the institution. No other logos or individual units within EPFL can be added.</p>
		<h3>Use of EPFL logo</h3>
		<p>The EPFL logo can be used on:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>All written material (letters, brochures, leaflets, programs, flyers, reports, etc.)</li>
			<li>All visual communication material (posters, slides, films, etc.)</li>
			<li>All EPFL websites and pages (URL must include epfl.ch)</li>
		</ul>
		<p>This rule is valid for all above-mentioned materials published by EPFL offical units and associations, as well as their partners in joint activities (eg. congreses, forums, conferences, seminars, lectures, academic or cultural events, etc.).</p>
		<h3>Logo placement</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Letterhead, business cards: the EPFL logo must be placed at the top-right corner (<a href="http://repro.epfl.ch">contact the print center for more precise information</a>);</li>
			<li>Websites: the EPFL logo must be placed at the top-left corner (<a href="http://atelierweb.epfl.ch/page-64962-fr.html">please read about the web digital identity</a>).</li>
		</ul>
		<p>For all other media, please respect the logo and its visibility.</p>
		<h2>Use by students associations</h2>
		<p>The use of EPFL&nbsp;logo by students associations is subject to certain terms and conditions. Please read about them on <a href="http://associations.epfl.ch/page-16318-en.html">the DAF&nbsp;associations website</a>.</p>
		<h2>Denominations: use of capital and lower cases</h2>
		<p><strong>Ecole polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne</strong><br>
	Only the word "Ecole" takes a capital letter.<br>
	In English, we refer simply to "EPFL", which is one of two Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology.</p>
		<p><strong>Units</strong><br>
	When designating a specific unit, only the first word must take a capital letter (e.g. "the Faculty of life sciences", "the Section of mechanical engineering"). In more general contexts (e.g. one of the School faculties), the first word can be written with a lower-case letter.</p>
		<p><strong>Professor</strong><br>
	If the title is quoted in a conference, "Professor" must be written with a capital letter.<br>
	When talking about professors in general, lower cases must be used.</p>
