title: Nav
name: nav
notes: |
  The navigation has two different modes: **solid** and **toggle**. To differentiate the CSS and js behavior, we use the classes `.nav-toggle` and `.nav-solid` on an element wrapping the `.nav-main`, inside of the `<body>` tag.

  Both navigations will behave the same way on mobile.
