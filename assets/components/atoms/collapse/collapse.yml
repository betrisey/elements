    notes: |
      This component is **mobile only by default** as in the footer. To offer also the same behaviour on desktop, use the `collapse-title-desktop` and `collapse-item-desktop` classes like below.
notes: |
  The collapse JavaScript plugin is used to show and hide content. Buttons or anchors are used as triggers that are mapped to specific elements you toggle. Collapsing an element will `animate the height` from itâ€™s current value to `0`. Given how CSS handles animations, you cannot use padding on a `.collapse` element. Instead, use the class as an independent wrapping element.
