title: Collapse
name: collapse
notes: |
  The collapse component contains chunks of content. You can display of hide this content by triggering the component. Use the collapse component when content is dense and you want to suggest extra readings. The collapsed content should not be critical for the reader. You may also allow some collapsible items to be open at the same time.

  The collapse JavaScript plugin is used to show and hide content. Buttons or anchors are used as triggers that are mapped to specific elements you toggle. Collapsing an element will `animate the height` from itâ€™s current value to `0`. Given how CSS handles animations, you cannot use padding on a `.collapse` element. Instead, use the class as an independent wrapping element.

  These elements can be used in groups. It can be used to display various type of informations, the most common use being FAQ sections. For more informations, see [the content-group molecule](/#/molecules/collapse-group).
